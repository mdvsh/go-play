### 4_slices

also contains some arrays

- slices are typed only by the elements they contain (not the number of elements)
- package main will only contain integration of other packages and not unit-testable code and hence Go will not allow you to import a package with name main.
- size is encoded in arrays types (slice doesn't have this)


vscode go integration is very very epic
